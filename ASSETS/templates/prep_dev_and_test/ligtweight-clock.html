      /**
       * This example uses the lightweight-clock library which prioritizes performance.
       * It updates the clock display using internal timers optimized for smooth ticking.
       *
       * With this library, you set up a clock instance and then call its 'show' method,
       * passing your chosen display element. (The library is designed to work with minimal configuration.)
       *
       * We also integrate the Page Visibility API:
       * - When the tab is hidden, you can pause the ticking (if the library supports pause/resume).
       * - When the tab is visible, you resume (or reinitialize) the clock immediately.
       *
       * Note: The actual options and API depend on the library version. This example assumes
       * a simple API: once instantiated, the clock updates the element continuously.
