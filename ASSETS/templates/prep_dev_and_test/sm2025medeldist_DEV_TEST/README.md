# Problem with text not shown for runner (bib, name, club)

## First attempt for fix

The text is likely being inserted correctly but isn’t visible because of how the elements are being sized and clipped by your CSS. In flex layouts—in particular when you impose fixed widths along with overflow handling—the default behavior can sometimes prevent the content from shrinking properly. Here are some points and a common fix:

1. **Default Flex Item Behavior:**  
   In a flex container, elements’ default value for the `min-width` property is often set to `auto`, which means they won’t shrink below the size of their content. When you also use properties like

   ```css
   overflow: hidden;
   text-overflow: ellipsis;
   white-space: nowrap;
   ```

   the expected behavior is that content gets truncated with an ellipsis. However, if the element isn’t allowed to shrink (because of its intrinsic minimum width), the entire text may effectively be clipped and not rendered as you expect.

2. **What’s Happening in Your Case:**

   - The elements with the IDs `"vald_runner_bib"`, `"vald_runner_name"`, and `"club_name"` reside inside flex items (the `.runner` div and its children).
   - You’ve set fixed widths (e.g., `width: 12.5rem` for `.runner .name` and `.runner .club`), and you also have `overflow: hidden` with ellipsis.
   - However, without overriding the default minimum size, the flex items might not shrink as intended. In some cases, that can cause their inner text to be rendered outside of the visible area (or be completely clipped) even though the value is set.

3. **The Common Fix:**  
   Add a rule to allow these flex items to shrink appropriately by setting:

   ```css
   .runner .bib,
   .runner .name,
   .runner .club {
     min-width: 0;
   }
   ```

   This explicitly tells the browser that these flex items **can** shrink below their intrinsic content width. Once they’re allowed to shrink, the `overflow: hidden` and `text-overflow: ellipsis` rules can work as intended and display at least an ellipsis when the text is too long.

4. **Additional Debugging Tips:**
   - **Check in Chrome Developer Tools:** Inspect the elements (e.g., using the Elements tab) and review the computed styles. Verify that the effective width of these elements allows you to see the text.
   - **Temporarily Remove Overflow Rules:** As a debugging step, remove or disable `overflow: hidden` on the affected elements to see if the text becomes visible. That can confirm whether clipping is the problem.

---

**In Summary:**  
Although your JavaScript sets the text content correctly, the flex layout’s default min-width settings can interfere with the sizing and clipping of flex items. By adding `min-width: 0;` to your flex children (those containing `"vald_runner_bib"`, `"vald_runner_name"`, and `"club_name"`), you should allow them to shrink properly so that the text either appears fully or shows truncated with an ellipsis as desired.

---

## Second attempt for fix

There are a couple of possibilities that could be causing your text not to show. Even after adding

```css
.runner .bib,
.runner .name,
.runner .club {
  min-width: 0;
}
```

the issue can persist when the flex properties and fixed widths conflict with the desired truncation behavior. Here are some suggestions to investigate and try:

---

### 1. **Fixed Width with Flex-Grow**

You’ve defined your `.runner .name` and `.runner .club` with a fixed width (12.5rem) together with a flex-grow property (for `.runner .name`). In a flex context, that can sometimes lead to unexpected sizing. In many examples for truncation in flex containers, authors remove the fixed width and instead let the item’s base size be 0 by using a shorthand like:

```css
.runner .name {
  flex: 1 1 0;
  padding-right: 1rem;
  font-weight: bold;
  color: #301525;
  text-align: left;
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
```

This tells the browser that the item should shrink from a 0 base instead of from a fixed 12.5rem. You could apply a similar change for the `.runner .club` if you want the same behavior.

---

### 2. **Wrapping the Text Content**

Your HTML wraps the text within a `<span>` inside the `.name` and `.club` divs:

```html
<div class="name"><span id="vald_runner_name"></span></div>
```

Sometimes the inline nature of spans can cause issues with ellipsis in flex items. You could try one of these:

- Apply the text-overflow and related properties directly to the span:

  ```css
  .runner .name span,
  .runner .club span {
    display: block; /* or inline-block */
    width: 100%;
    overflow: hidden;
    text-overflow: ellipsis;
    white-space: nowrap;
  }
  ```

- Or remove the extra wrapper and apply the styles directly to the container (if your markup allows it).

---

### 3. **Double-Check for Conflicting Styles**

Make sure that no other rules are inadvertently overriding your text color or forcing the element to have a zero width. For example, even though you’ve set a fixed width on `.runner .name`, if another rule comes later and sets `width: 0` or `display: none` for the inner span, that would hide the text.

---

### 4. **Testing in Developer Tools**

Open Chrome Developer Tools and inspect one of the affected elements (for example, the element with id `vald_runner_name`). Look at its “Computed” style and its box model. Check that:

- The computed width is what you expect.
- The element is not being collapsed.
- The correct styles (overflow, white-space, text-overflow) are applied and not overridden.

Sometimes you may find that the flex parent’s sizing behavior forces the content box of the flex child to a smaller size than expected.

---

### A Revised CSS Approach (Example)

Here’s one way to rework the flex child styling for the text elements:

```css
.runner {
  background-color: white;
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
  font-size: 1.125rem;
  color: #301525;
  white-space: nowrap;
}

/* Other fixed-width items remain unchanged */
.runner .place {
  font-weight: bold;
  min-width: 60px;
  padding: 0 1.25rem;
  text-align: center;
  border-right: 2px solid #b14340;
}

.runner .bib {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: #548889;
  font-size: 0.75rem;
  width: 2.5rem;
  text-align: center;
}

/* Let .name and .club flex appropriately instead of a hard fixed width */
.runner .name,
.runner .club {
  flex: 1 1 0; /* Allows items to shrink and grow from a 0 base */
  padding-right: 1rem;
  text-align: left;
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
}

/* Optionally, if you’re wrapping text in spans, style them too */
.runner .name span,
.runner .club span {
  display: block; /* or inline-block */
  width: 100%;
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
  white-space: nowrap;
}

/* Prevent any flex-child from forcing a minimum width */
.runner .bib,
.runner .name,
.runner .club {
  min-width: 0;
}

.runner .time {
  width: 6.25rem;
  font-weight: bold;
  text-align: right;
  background-color: #548889;
  color: white;
  padding: 0.625rem;
}
```

This revised approach removes the fixed width on the `.name` and `.club` divs and uses flex shorthand with a zero base. The inner `<span>` contents are forced to truncate if they overflow. This is a common pattern to get ellipsis working properly in flex items.

---

### Conclusion

Even though you added `min-width: 0;` correctly, the combination of a fixed width with `flex-grow: 1` and the nested inline spans may be conflicting with the intended text-overflow behavior. Try removing the fixed width and using a flex shorthand (`flex: 1 1 0;`) on the elements (or moving the ellipsis styles to a nested block element such as a span), and then verify the computed styles using Chrome Developer Tools. This should allow the text to appear and be truncated with an ellipsis if it overflows.

## Issue still remains

Based on what you’ve described and the fact that you can see other elements (such as the clock container and hard-coded content) animate correctly, the inline styles in your head section are **unlikely** to be the root cause. In particular:

1. **Opacity on `.graphic` is Part of the Animation Workflow:**  
   The inline rule

   ```css
   .graphic {
     opacity: 0;
   }
   ```

   simply sets the initial state so that the container is hidden until your anime.js animation runs. Since your animation immediately (or almost immediately) sets the opacity from 0 to 1, that rule should no longer be “active” once the fade‑in completes. The fact that other parts of your overlay are visible means the animation is working as intended.

2. **The Inline Rules for the Runner Text Elements:**  
   Your inline code only adds extra spacing (for example, `#vald_runner_bib { margin-right: 1em; }` and `#club_name { padding: 0 0.8em; }`). These rules do not force the text to be hidden. They lack any properties such as `display: none`, `visibility: hidden`, or an opacity setting that would make the text disappear.

3. **Other Possibilities:**  
   Since the inline styles themselves don’t hide those elements, you may need to consider other factors:
   - **Element Sizing:** Check whether the flex container or the runner elements are causing the inner span elements to collapse or have zero available width. (Even though you’ve applied fixes like `min-width: 0`, it’s worth rechecking in the Chrome Elements panel to confirm the computed width.)
   - **Timing of Content Insertion:** Verify that your JavaScript is actually inserting the text after all the animations and CSS have been applied and that nothing later in the code is overwriting or clearing the innerHTML.
   - **Other Conflicting CSS:** Look for any later CSS rules (in imported stylesheets or inline) that might be affecting these elements. For example, rules that might be setting a font size to 0, a color that blends into the background, or even something that inadvertently hides or clips the content.

---

### Debugging Steps

Here are some concrete steps you can take in Chrome Developer Tools:

- **Inspect the Elements:** Right-click on the runner text elements (e.g., the span with `id="vald_runner_name"`) and select “Inspect.” Look at the **Computed** styles to see if any unexpected properties (like `width: 0`, `font-size: 0`, or unexpected `display` settings) are affecting them.

- **Check the DOM Content:** Confirm that the span elements actually contain the expected text. Expand the nodes in the Elements panel to see if the inner text is present—even if it isn’t visually obvious.

- **Temporarily Disable Animations:** For debugging, you can modify the inline style (or override it) so that `.graphic { opacity: 1 !important; }` stays in place. This can help determine if the fade‑in animation is somehow interfering with the display of the text.

- **Review the Cascade:** In Developer Tools, look at the list of applied styles (the “Styles” pane) for the affected elements to see if any later rules are overriding your intended styles.

---

### Conclusion

The inline styles you shared in the head (including the `.graphic { opacity: 0; }` rule and the rules for `#vald_runner_bib` and `#club_name`) only contribute spacing or initial states for animations and do not hide the text by themselves. Since your animation functions are running and other elements are visible, the missing text is likely due to another issue—possibly related to flex item sizing, content insertion timing, or another conflicting rule.
